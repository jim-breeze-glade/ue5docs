## Usage Instructions

### Windows

1. **Initial Setup:**
   ```cmd
   # Double-click or run in Command Prompt
   setup_windows.bat
   ```

2. **Run Scraper:**
   ```cmd
   # Double-click or run in Command Prompt
   run_scraper.bat
   ```

3. **Test Installation:**
   ```cmd
   # Double-click or run in Command Prompt
   test_windows.bat
   ```

### Linux/Unix

1. **Initial Setup:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_arch.sh
   ./setup_arch.sh
   ```

   ```bash
   chmod +x run_scraper.sh
   ./run_scraper.sh
   ```

3. **Test Installation:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x test_linux.sh
   ./test_linux.sh
   ```

## Log Files

All scripts generate detailed log files:

- `setup.log` - Setup process logs
- `scraper.log` - Scraper execution logs  
- `test_results.log` - Test execution logs

## Error Handling

### Common Exit Codes

- `0` - Success
- `1` - General error (missing files, failed operations)
- `2` - Invalid environment or configuration
- `3` - Dependency issues

### Error Recovery

1. **Check log files** for detailed error information
2. **Verify dependencies** using test scripts
3. **Re-run setup scripts** if dependencies are missing
4. **Check permissions** if file operations fail

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Defensive Programming**
   - Input validation
   - Error checking after each operation
   - Graceful failure handling

2. **User-Friendly Design**
   - Clear progress indicators
   - Informative error messages
   - Helpful troubleshooting guidance

3. **Maintainability**
   - Comprehensive comments
   - Modular function design
   - Consistent variable naming

4. **Security**
   - Quoted paths to handle spaces
   - Minimal privilege requirements
   - Safe temporary file handling

5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Platform-specific optimizations
   - Standardized functionality
   - Proper path handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Virtual Environment Not Found**
   - Run setup script first
   - Check if Python is properly installed

2. **Dependency Import Failures**
   - Run test script to identify missing packages
   - Re-run setup script to reinstall dependencies

3. **Permission Issues (Linux)**
   - Ensure scripts have execute permissions
   - Run with appropriate sudo privileges for system packages

4. **Path Issues**
   - Ensure scripts are run from the project directory
   - Check that all required files are present

### Support

For additional support, check the generated log files which contain detailed information about:
- Execution steps taken
- Error conditions encountered
- System configuration details
- Dependency status
